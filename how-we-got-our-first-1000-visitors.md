Summary: After pnr.me was built, the next objective was to publicize it to potential users. We decided to publicize by posting in 4 different websites. We take you through our successes and failures

[pnr.me](http://pnr.me "pnr.me") was built and it was working like a breeze, but sadly there were no visitors. What is the use of building an awesome website and no one to benefit from it?. Decision was made that we would publicize pnr.me in the following 4 sites

+ [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/ "hacker news")
+ [hackerstreet](http://hackerstreet.in/ "hacker street india")
+ [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/ "reddit")
+ [rodinhood](http://therodinhoods.com/ "the rodinhoods")

We had a mix of successes and failures and here is how it all went

Hackernews
----------
Hackernews need no introduction and we assumed that although the audience is highly US centric, there will be sizable amount of indian audience who would be interested in pnr prediction. That assumption turned out to be entirely wrong and we got no upvotes for the [original post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6633391 "hackernews").

Hacker Street India
-------------------
[hackerstreet](http://hackerstreet.in/ "hacker street india") is a community of indian entrepreneurs and technical enthusiasts with heavy influences from hackernews. Pnr prediction is a problem most of them have faced atleast once and we got [amazing response](http://hackerstreet.in/item?id=31093 "hackerstreet feedback for pnr.me") both in terms of visits and feedback from Hackerstreet

Reddit
------
We were very confused about which sub reddit to use. Should we go for [india sub reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/ "India") or [trains sub reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/trains/ "trains")?. We finally decided to publicize in trains sub reddit, assuming that since our product had everything to do with trains, it should be the right place to publicize. We were wrong and we got more downvotes than upvotes

The Rodinhoods
--------------
We stumbled on a rodinhoods post about possibility of using [past data to predict pnr charting status](http://therodinhoods.com/forum/topics/site-for-checking-probability-for-getting-confirmed-train-ticket?xg_source=activity "probability of ticket getting confirmed") while browsing for [pnr prediction](http://pnr.me/predictor "pnr prediction"). We found the community to be active and were giving generally good feedback and hence we created a [showcase post in rodinhoods](http://therodinhoods.com/forum/topics/instantly-predict-final-charting-status-of-indian-railways "pnr prediction at rodinhoods").

The initial response were good and our traffic data was showing a spike. But we were not prepared for traffic that would come after [Alok Rodinhood Kejriwal](https://www.facebook.com/rodinhood "Alok Rodinhood Kejriwal") shared the post in his facebook page. we had a huge jump in traffic which caused an [internal service error](|filename|/no-more-internal-service-error.md "How we solved internal service error") and we were offline for almost two hours. Unexpected but an amazing marketing win

october 29 and 30th spike is due to hackerstreet and november 6th spike is due to rodinhoods

Lessons Learned
---------------
+ Always publicize it to the right audience. Do not rely on a minority audience as the chances that they will be able to upvote or discuss about your work is highly remote
+ Do not post on sub reddits with very few audience
+ Keep a close watch on errors. First impression could very well be the last one.
