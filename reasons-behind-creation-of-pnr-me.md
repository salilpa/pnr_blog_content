Summary: pnr.me was created to help Indian Railways passengers to better predict their final pnr charting status. The problem we are trying to solve and solution are briefly discussed here

[pnr.me](http://pnr.me/ "pnr.me") was created to ease the difficulty passengers were having in predicting whether or not their waiting list train tickets will get confirmed. Here is a brief introduction to the problem and how we are trying to solve this problem

The problem
-----------

Indian railways is the biggest mover of people and goods in India. The demand far exceeds supply and it is very usual for busy trains to have a waiting list of more than 500. The holders of these waiting list tickets do not have a right to board the train and will only get that privilege if some one with a confirmed ticket cancels his/her ticket.

How would you know whether your waiting list will get confirmed or not?. Simple answer is no, you cannot. But by looking at past data, one can predict with reasonable accuracy whether waiting list ticket will get confirmed or not.

The solution
------------

[pnr prediction tool](http://pnr.me/predictor "pnr prediction") takes pnr number as input and tries to predict the ticket`s final charting status. The prediction tool works by looking at similar pnr numbers and how their waiting list changed over time. It uses this data to make a sufficiently [accurate prediction](http://pnr.me/accuracy "prediction accuracy")

Some stats
----------

Every year indian railways generate around 750 crores as cancellation charges. Every 1 in 3 train tickets booked are cancelled. [pnr.me](http://pnr.me/ "pnr.me") hopes to reduce that number.
